## Overview

**z3-Agent** is a production-ready, multi-channel AI customer service agent that intelligently handles conversations across Instagram and Telegram platforms. Built with modern software engineering principles, it combines the power of Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver context-aware, accurate, and natural responses to customer queries.

Unlike simple chatbots that rely solely on pre-programmed responses or basic LLM calls, z3-Agent implements a sophisticated orchestration system that **intelligently routes queries** through different processing pipelines. A supervisor agent analyzes each incoming message to determine the optimal strategy: respond directly for casual conversation, search internal documentation for technical questions, fetch real-time information from the web for current events, or combine multiple sources for complex queries.

The system is designed from the ground up for **scalability and extensibility**. Its clean channel-based architecture means adding support for WhatsApp, Discord, or any other messaging platform requires minimal effort—simply implement the `BaseChannel` interface. With comprehensive monitoring, alert systems, and production-ready patterns baked in from day one, z3-Agent isn't just a proof of concept—it's a robust foundation for real-world customer service automation.

                            Reply Generation → Send via Channel API
```

### Core Components

#### **1. Channels Layer** (`app/channels/`)
Provides platform abstraction through `BaseChannel` interface. Each channel (Instagram, Telegram) implements:
- `process_message()`: Main message processing pipeline
- `extract_message_data()`: Platform-specific data extraction
- `send_reply()`: Platform API integration
- `get_session_id()`: Conversation thread management

**Why this design?** Enables adding new platforms (WhatsApp, Discord) with ~200 lines of code. Clean separation prevents cross-platform bugs and allows platform-specific optimizations.

#### **2. Core Processing** (`app/core/`)
Shared intelligence layer across all channels:

- **Router** (`router.py`): Supervisor agent powered by Gemini LLM. Analyzes query intent, complexity, and context to determine optimal processing strategy (direct/docs/web/all).

- **RAG System** (`rag.py`): Vector-based retrieval using FAISS with HuggingFace embeddings. Searches internal documentation, ranks results by relevance, and extracts context for reply generation.

- **Reply Generator** (`reply.py`): Combines conversation history, retrieved context, and persona configuration to generate natural, context-aware responses via Gemini.

**Why shared core?** Reduces code duplication, ensures consistent AI behavior across platforms, and makes improvements benefit all channels simultaneously.

#### **3. Monitoring System** (`app/monitoring/`)
Production-grade observability built from the start:

- **Enhanced Metrics** (`enhanced_metrics.py`): Singleton metrics collector tracking requests, errors, latencies, and user activity per channel.

- **Alert System** (`simple_alerts.py`): Telegram notifications for critical issues (error rate >10%, response time >5s) with 15-minute cooldown to prevent spam.

- **Real-time Dashboard** (`dashboard.py`): Streamlit interface showing live metrics, channel breakdown, user activity, and RAG effectiveness.

- **Request Logger** (`request_logger.py`): JSONL-based structured logging for analysis and debugging.

**Why comprehensive monitoring?** Early-stage systems fail silently. Built-in observability means you detect issues immediately, understand user patterns, and optimize before scaling.

#### **4. Storage & Memory**
- **Vector Store** (`data/vector_store/`): FAISS index for semantic search across documentation
- **Instagram Memory** (`data/conversations.json`): Simple JSON-based conversation history
- **Telegram Memory** (`data/telegram_memory.db`): LangChain-managed SQLite for rich conversation context

**Why different memory systems?** Platform-specific requirements: Instagram needs lightweight JSON, Telegram benefits from LangChain's built-in thread management and message history features.

### Design Philosophy

**Layer separation**: Channels → Core → Services ensures changes to Instagram don't break Telegram, and vice versa.

**Shared intelligence**: Router, RAG, and Reply logic live in `core/` so all channels benefit from improvements.

**Configuration as code**: Prompts and personality in version-controlled JSON files enable rapid iteration without code changes.

**Data isolation**: Each channel's conversation history uses appropriate storage (JSON for simple, SQLite for complex).

**Observability first-class**: Monitoring isn't bolted on—it's integrated into BaseChannel from the start.

---

## Design Decisions

### Why Channel Abstraction?
**Problem**: Adding new messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Discord, LinkedIn) shouldn't require rewriting core AI logic.

**Solution**: `BaseChannel` interface defines contract: `process_message()`, `send_reply()`, `extract_message_data()`. Each platform implements interface while sharing Router, RAG, and Reply components.

**Impact**: Adding WhatsApp support = ~200 lines of code. No risk of breaking Instagram or Telegram.

### Why Local Embeddings?
**Problem**: OpenAI/Cohere embeddings cost $0.0001 per 1K tokens. At 10K queries/day with RAG = $300/month just for embeddings.

**Solution**: HuggingFace `sentence-transformers` runs locally. One-time model download (~150MB), then infinite embeddings at zero cost.

**Trade-off**: Slightly lower quality vs. OpenAI Ada-002, but 90% accuracy at 0% ongoing cost = clear win for early-stage products.

### Why Comprehensive Monitoring from Day One?
**Problem**: Most projects add monitoring after first production incident. By then, you've lost critical debugging data.

**Solution**: Built-in metrics collection in `BaseChannel`, automatic alert system, real-time dashboard. Every request tracked from day one.

**Impact**: When error rate spikes, you get Telegram alert immediately. Dashboard shows which user, which channel, which routing mode failed. Debug in minutes instead of hours.

### Why LangChain vs. Custom Orchestration?
**Problem**: Building chains, memory management, retriever logic from scratch = 1000+ lines of boilerplate code.

**Solution**: LangChain provides proven abstractions (ConversationBufferMemory, VectorStoreRetriever) with built-in error handling and callbacks.

**Trade-off**: Adds dependency weight (~50MB), but eliminates bugs and accelerates development. When you need custom logic, LangGraph migration path exists.

### Why Separate Memory Systems?
**Problem**: Instagram only needs "last 5 messages" history. Telegram needs rich conversation threading and user context.

**Solution**: Instagram uses lightweight JSON. Telegram uses LangChain's SQLite-backed memory with built-in thread management.

**Impact**: Right tool for right job. Instagram stays fast and simple. Telegram gets sophisticated context without overcomplicating Instagram code.
